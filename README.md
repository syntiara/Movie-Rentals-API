## Documentation

I have implemented swagger for proper code documentation, using [swagger-ui-express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-express) and [swagger-jsdoc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-jsdoc)

You can launch this with `npm run start:dev`

Navigate to `http://localhost:50300/api` on your preferred browser


## Testing

Server side tests - Run `npm test` on the terminal while within the **project root directory**.

server side testing is achieved through the use of `jest` package. `jest` is a testing framework, used to test javascript code.
